Microbial cell factories offer new and sustainable production routes for high-value chemicals. However, identification of high producers within a library of clones remains a challenge. When product formation is coupled to growth, millions of metabolic variants can be effectively interrogated by growth selection, dramatically increasing the throughput of strain evaluation. While growth-coupled selections for cell factories have a long history of success based on metabolite auxotrophies and toxic antimetabolites, such methods are generally restricted to molecules native to their host metabolism. New synthetic biology tools offer the opportunity to rewire cellular metabolism to depend on specific and non-native products for growth.
