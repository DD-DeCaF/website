Summary
CoBAMP is a modular framework for the enumeration of pathway analysis concepts, such as elementary flux modes (EFM) and minimal cut sets in genome-scale constraint-based models (CBMs) of metabolism. It currently includes the K-shortest EFM algorithm and facilitates integration with other frameworks involving reading, manipulation and analysis of CBMs.
Availability and implementation
The software is implemented in Python 3, supported on most operating systems and requires a mixed-integer linear programming optimizer supported by the optlang framework. Source-code is available at https://github.com/BioSystemsUM/cobamp.
