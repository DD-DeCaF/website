          <h4>Biosyntia ApS</h4>
          <p>Biosyntia is a synthetic biology and biocatalysis company founded in 2012 by Dr. Hans Genee and Professor Dr. Morten Sommer. The company applies evolutionary metabolic engineering for the development of microbial cell factories of fine chemical products. Biosyntia’s R&D process involves iterative cycles of pathway design, construction and high throughput testing, and a major challenge is the analysis and interpretation of the ever increasing amounts of data generated. Furthermore, in the search for more efficient pathway routes, Biosyntia functionally interrogates metagenomics for novel genes and pathways. Biosyntia is funded by various EU grants and a seed investment from Novo Seeds.
