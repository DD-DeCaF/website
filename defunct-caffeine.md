<h3>Caffeine out of order</h3>
<p class="flow-text">Looking for Caffeine? Unfortunately, I am leaving academia and I won't be able to keep the lights on any longer. I am working on a new hosting home for Caffeine but I am not sure I will succeed.</p>

<p class="flow-text">Cheers, <br>Niko</p>

<p class="flow-text">PS: Please get in touch with me at <a href="mailto:niko.sonnenschein@gmail.com">niko.sonnenschein@gmail.com</a> if you're interested in reviving it, would like some pointers on how to host it yourself (all the source code is still available at <a href="https://github.com/dd-decaf">github.com/dd-decaf</a>), or would like to help out with a new hosting solution for Caffeine (managed kubernetes would be great).</p>

<p class="flow-text">Never used Caffeine or would like to dwell in nostalgia? Check out the screencast below.</p>
