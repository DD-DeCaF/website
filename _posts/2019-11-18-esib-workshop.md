The DD-DeCaF 3rd Workshop: Computer-aided design of cell factories will be integrated in the European Summit of Industrial Biotechnology (ESIB), to be held in Graz, Austria.


<li>Venue: ESIB, Graz, Austria</li>
<li>Date: November 18-20</li>
<li>Target audience: Industry and academia</li>

[Registration](https://www.esib.at/registration/)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In this summit, DD-DeCaF will be represented in two distinct occasions. On the 2nd day, in the H2020 special workshop Markus Herrgard will be representing DD-DeCaf and on the 3rd day a hands-on workshop focused on Computer-aided design of cell factories.</span></p>

Details about these two sessions follow bellow. The full ESIB program can be accessed [here](https://www.esib.at/program/)

The extensive use of omics data, bioinformatic tools and metabolic modelling are common features of many projects that aim to construct such cell factories. A panel of selected H2020 projects discuss their central question: How to engineer cell factories to enable them to use sustainable carbon sources and to increase yields?<br>

<h2>Day 3</span></h2>

<tr class="row-7">
	<td class="column-1"><span style="color:#c7d300"><strong> Session VI</strong><br><img src="http://www.esib.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dot_green.png" alt="" width="20" height="20" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-576"></span></td><td class="column-2"><strong>10:00 – 12:00</strong></td><td class="column-3"><h4>Computer-aided design of cell factories</h4> Cell factory development projects often use omics data and modeling to identify bottlenecks and suggest new design strategies. However, the software platforms that are currently available for data-driven modeling and design support only limited use of data and are not end-user friendly. What are newest developments in computer-aided cell factory design? How can cutting edge software tools help you in developing your next cell factory? Join this workshop to learn hands-on skills for employing computer-aided cell factory design in your projects.<br>
